## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Component Architecture Improvements

#### Enhanced ModernCard System
```typescript
// Extend current ModernCard with accessibility
interface ModernCardProps {
  variant: 'default' | 'elevated' | 'glass' | 'glass-strong' | 'gradient' | 'interactive'
  accessibility: {
    role?: string
    ariaLabel?: string
    keyboardNavigable?: boolean
  }
  progressive?: boolean // Enable progressive disclosure
}
```

#### New Navigation Components
```typescript
// Simplified navigation structure
interface NavigationSection {
  id: 'my-health' | 'care-services' | 'insights-tools'
  label: string
  description: string
  items: NavigationItem[]
  defaultExpanded?: boolean
}
```

### Design System Enhancements

#### Color System Improvements
```css
/* Healthcare-specific semantic tokens */
:root {
  /* Progressive disclosure indicators */
  --disclosure-available: hsl(var(--primary) / 0.1);
  --disclosure-active: hsl(var(--primary) / 0.2);
  
  /* Accessibility contrast ratios */
  --text-high-contrast: hsl(220 13% 5%);
  --bg-high-contrast: hsl(0 0% 100%);
  
  /* Mobile-optimized touch targets */
  --touch-target-min: 44px;
  --mobile-nav-height: 56px;
}
```

#### Accessibility Classes
```css
.keyboard-focus {
  @apply focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary focus-visible:ring-offset-2;
}

.screen-reader-only {
  @apply sr-only;
}

.high-contrast-mode {
  @apply contrast-more:bg-background contrast-more:text-foreground;
}
```
